# JokeChain
![Snapshot](image.png)
JokeChain is a web app that uses LangChain and the Google PaLM language model to predict jokes for asked questions. It is built with Streamlit, a Python library for creating web apps.
#How JokeChain works:

JokeChain first uses LangChain to break down the user's question into a sequence of tokens. These tokens are then passed to the Google PaLM language model, which generates a sequence of tokens that it predicts will form a joke. The JokeChain web app then displays the generated joke to the user.

#Overview
JokeChain is a fun and creative application that leverages advanced language models to generate jokes. It uses the following key components:

LangChain: LangChain is a language model that understands and processes natural language. It serves as the foundation for handling user queries and generating responses.

LLM (GooglePalm): The app uses GooglePalm, a large language model, to create humorous and witty responses to user questions. This is where the magic of joke generation happens.

Streamlit UI: The user interface of JokeChain is built with Streamlit, making it easy for users to input questions or prompts and receive jokes in response.

Set Up Authentication: To use GooglePalm, you need to obtain API keys or credentials for authentication. Refer to the GooglePalm documentation for details on obtaining these keys.

Configure the App: Create a configuration file (e.g., config.json) and specify your API keys and other configuration settings. An example configuration file might look like this:

json
Copy code
{
  "googlepalm_api_key": "YOUR_GOOGLEPALM_API_KEY"
}
